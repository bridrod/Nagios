Monitoring Script for Dell Warranty; It pulls the Service Tag (STag) from target using OS or Device SNMP. The following is supported/tested:

1. From server OS (VMWare ESXi) or the iDRAC automatically as a backup (in case SNMP under the OS doesn't work);
2. From Chassis;
3. From Switch;

## Info
Dell has moved to a more secure method for obtaining information on devices (including warranty info). They moved away from API key (v4) to OAuthTLS2.0 (v5).

The deadline to continue using the v4 of the API key was Dec, 15th 2019.

In order to continue pulling device information from Dell's website it now requires v5. For that, you need to:


1. Submit a new request to obtain updated API credentials on TechDirect portal - https://techdirect.dell.com/portal.30/Login.aspx;

2. Obtain credentials "Client_ID" and "Client_Secret" from Dell (The script will need to be edited to update these variables);
 
 
 **Note:** FYI, each generated Bearer token will be valid for 3600 seconds.

For further details, please refer to SDK available on your Dell TechDirect account.

**Note:** In some cases, grabbing the STag might not be possible due to firewall, misconfigured/disabled SNMP settings in the Server OS or some other odd reason. To work around that, I enabled the option to pull it from the iDRAC automatically when type=server is selected and the script fails to pull from the Server OS. For that to work, you should have your iDRAC registered in DNS and using a pattern (i.e.: idrac-hostname). For this script we use "d-hostname". Feel free to modify it.

## Requirements
SNMP to be working (Server OS/Dell iDRAC, Dell Chassis, or Dell Switch);

**Note:** This is a linux script tested under openSUSE and Ubuntu distros

Requires **sed** and **snmpget** tool. snmpget can be found in:

package=**net-snmp** for openSUSE: ***sudo zypper in net-snmp***

package=**snmp** for Ubuntu:       ***sudo apt-get install snmp***

**Note:** Edit script and change the following lines (to match your environment):

iDRACHOSTNAME="d-$HOSTNAME" (optional; In case you are checking warranty against servers)
client_id='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
client_secret='yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy'
